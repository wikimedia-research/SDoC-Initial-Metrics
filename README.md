# Baseline Metrics for SDoC

As the [Structured Data on Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data) (SDoC) project ramps up, we'll need to figure out a baseline for metrics on [Wikimedia Commons](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Commons) in order to measure future successes. This work is tracked in Phabricator ticket [T174519](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T174519).

**Note**: [Manual:Database layout](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Database_layout) will be very useful in this endeavor.

    - [x] How many: mpeg's, png's, ogg's, etc.
